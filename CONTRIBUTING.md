## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Annoyance Methods
When adding new ways to bully developers:

1. **Respect System Resources**: Don't crash VS Code with excessive notifications
2. **User Control**: Always provide a way to disable/reduce new features
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle edge cases without breaking the extension
4. **Documentation**: Update README and changelog with new harassment methods

### Message Guidelines
New bully messages should be:
- **Firm but caring** - the goal is health, not actual harassment
- **Appropriately aggressive** for their annoyance level
- **Professional enough** for workplace use
- **Inclusive and respectful** - no offensive content

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Good: Clear harassment logic
function escalateAnnoyance() {
  if (ignoreCount > 3) {
    enableNuclearMode();
  }
}

// Bad: Unclear purpose
function doStuff() {
  // mysterious harassment code
}
```
